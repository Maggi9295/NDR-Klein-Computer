# NDR-Klein-Computer
KiCad Schematics of the "NDR Klein Computer".

This Computer was engineered by Rolf-Dieter Klein around 30 Years ago. It is modular and features a Z80 processor in its basic configuartion, but can be upgraded to a Z180, a 68008, the 16-Bit processor 68000 or even the 32-Bit 68020 using two backplanes.

Further information like pictures, schematics and maunuals can be obtained at this website(German):

Current KiCad Schematics are aviable for the following modules:

I have not checked any of thoose for errors, so please expect that there might be small mistakes in the schematics. More modules will follow as soon as possible.
